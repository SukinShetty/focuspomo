# Simple Focus Timer

This is a Pomodoro-style focus timer application built with Next.js, designed to help users manage their work sessions and breaks effectively.

## Purpose

Key features include:
- Customizable work and break durations
- Visual and audio alerts when timers complete
- Task management to track work items during focus sessions
- Session tracking to monitor productivity over time
